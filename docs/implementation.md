# Implementation

## Introduction
TODO: Describe the system implemented (Describe the dataset. Are there any known issues? Describe any configuration data).

## Project Structure
TODO: Provide an outline of the project folder structure and the role of each file within it.
provide a table listing the number of jslint warnings/reports for each module.

## Software Architecture
The major components of the software architecture are listed below:

    <h3> <b>Client-side Components</b> </h3>
     <p> UI serves as the primary point of interaction between users and the website, facilitating information access, navigation, interaction, feedback, and brand representation. At the same time, client-side scripting with JavaScript frameworks empowers developers to create dynamic, interactive, and feature-rich web applications that deliver engaging user experiences across different platforms and devices. A well-designed UI enhances the user experience, promotes engagement, and contributes to the website's success.</p>
    <h5> User Interface (UI) </h5>
    <p>The User Interface (UI) is a crucial component of a website that helps users locate locations and services for several reasons: </p>
    <li> User Experience (UX): The UI directly impacts the user experience. An intuitive and visually appealing interface enhances user satisfaction and encourages users to engage with the website. Clear navigation, well-designed forms, and interactive elements make it easier for users to find the necessary information. </li>
    <li> Information Access: The UI provides users with access to various features and functionalities of the website, such as maps, search bars, filters, and interactive elements. These UI components enable users to search for specific locations, browse service listings, apply filters to refine search results and interact with the website's content.</li>
    <li> Interactivity: Interactive UI elements allow users to interact with the website in meaningful ways. For example, users can input search queries, select filters to narrow down search results, click on map markers to view location details and interact with service listings to learn more about available services. </li>
    <li> Visual Representation: UI components like maps and visual representations of locations provide users with spatial context and help them visualize the geographical distribution of services. Maps allow users to explore locations visually, view nearby amenities, and plan routes to desired destinations. </li>
    <li> Accessibility: A well-designed UI ensures accessibility for users with diverse needs and abilities. Features such as clear labelling, sufficient colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility make the website accessible to a wider audience, including users with disabilities. </li>
