# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
The 'Where To' project aims to make advice drop-in centres more utilised in Bristol by giving users one place to locate the services and see which centre is most suitable for their personal situations. The app will be designed for users who may be affected by several factors in their personal lives such as finances, housing, welfare, debt etc.. who may not be aware of, or struggle to find a place of support. In which the app will provide information (location and type) that can help users to utilise the services that are already within their local area, and can help them to overcome welfare dilemmas. 


### Business benefits
After having identified the problem, we have reflected this on what benefits our app could create, and how we can overcome the problem statement. This is crucial as we would like to create an app that can benefit the local community, whether it's the people who have access to the centres or the resources that are not being used to their full potential. Business benefits can identify what the user can do with our app. 

- Allows users to locate and have directions to their needed facilities
- Creates ease as the app will provide one place for users to seek where the centres are located and which ones can provide advice for their specific needs
- Utilising the services that are already offered to people living in Bristol
- Improve or contribute to quality of life for those who are not aware of their options via advice centres
  

### Options Considered
Below we have highlighted resources that have already been created, in which the user would be able to use these already. Each platform holds specific information and can help a user to reach the destination, whilst our app plans to provide all the relevant information you can find across these products, specifically for advice centres in Bristol. 

- Google Maps is already a service that can direct a user to the facilities. This app can already locate the nearest one to the user and offer directions, however, it can overwhelm users with information as it will not be able to identify which centres are suitable for the specific user's needs. 
- Each drop-in centre's website will already have in-depth descriptions about the services they offer and who can access them with the contact information provided as well.


### Expected Risks
It is significant to outline the risks that may be encountered during the planning and development of the app. This is so we are able to minimise the effect they may have during or after development. Additionally, when planning we can create methods to be able to overcome the expected risks. 

- The app could give a user incorrect directions
- Data being removed
- Another project may have a similar scope
- User confusion, they may not understand what the app can be used for 

## Project Scope
TODO: Scope of the System of Interest. Include a bullet list of things from your context diagram that are in scope.
