# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Advice drop-in: Users are having problems with several factors in their personal lives such as finances, housing, welfare, debt etc.. They may need access to advice which can help them to discuss and have access to options in order to overcome these dilemmas. This app aims to help users find the nearest advice drop-in centre to them that accommodates for what specific advice they may need and see what kind of services are available to them.




### Business benefits
- allows users to reach facilities that are accessible to them and can help them with their specific needs.
- makes the drop-in centres more accessible and easy as it is one place for users to seek this information.
- utilising the services that are already offered
- 
  

### Options Considered
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?

Advice drop in 
- Google Maps is already a service that can  direct a user to the facilities, it can give the ones located in the area and offer a live or satellite view, however, it can overwhelm users with information. 
- Drop-in centre websites will already have in-depth descriptions about the services they offer and who can access them which is more specific to a user's needs 




### Expected Risks

Advice drop in:
- could give a user incorrect directions
- data being removed
- another project with a similar scope
- user confusion - may not understand what the app can be used for
