# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
The 'Where To' project aims to make advice drop-in centres more utilised in Bristol by giving users one place to locate the services and see which centre is most suitable for their personal situations. The app will be designed for users who may be affected by several factors in their personal lives such as finances, housing, welfare, debt etc.. who may not be aware of, or struggle to find a place of support. In which the app will provide information (location and type) that can help users to utilise the services that are already within their local area, and can help them to overcome welfare dilemmas. 


### Business benefits
After recognizing the challenge, we have thoroughly contemplated the positive results our app could generate and its efficacy in resolving the identified issue. This is crucial, given our objective to create an app that provides tangible advantages to the local community. Whether it involves streamlining access to advice centers for individuals or maximizing the use of existing resources, our focus is on developing a solution that contributes meaningfully. Evaluating the business benefits is imperative, as it aids in outlining the concrete advantages users can derive from engaging with our app.

- Empowers users to find and receive directions to the facilities they require.
- Enhances convenience by consolidating information in one app, enabling users to easily discover the locations of advice centers that cater to their specific needs.
- Optimizes the utilization of existing services available to Bristol residents.
- Enhances or contributes to the quality of life for individuals who may be unaware of their options through advice centers.
  

### Options Considered
Below we have highlighted resources that have already been created, in which the user would be able to use these already. Each platform holds specific information and can help a user to reach the destination, whilst our app plans to provide all the relevant information you can find across these products, specifically for advice centres in Bristol. 

- Google Maps is already a service that can direct a user to the facilities. This app can already locate the nearest one to the user and offer directions, however, it can overwhelm users with information as it will not be able to identify which centres are suitable for the specific user's needs. 
- Each drop-in centre's website will already have in-depth descriptions about the services they offer and who can access them with the contact information provided as well.


### Expected Risks
It is significant to outline the risks that may be encountered during the planning and development of the app. This is so we are able to minimise the effect they may have during or after development. Additionally, when planning we can create methods to be able to overcome the expected risks. 

- The app could give a user incorrect directions
- Data being removed
- Another project may have a similar scope
- User confusion, they may not understand what the app can be used for
