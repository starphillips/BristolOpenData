## Where To

'Where To' is an app  that a user can use for several features to do with Advice Centres in Bristol. Our aim is for user to be able to identify a suitable Advice Drop-In Centre, based on their needs, and to locate the ones closest to them via map. The app is also offers to give users a direct route and ETA to the Advice Drop-In Centre using their prefered mode of transport (walk, bike, car, public transport etc..). Additionally, users can use the app to seek additional information about each centre such as written address, opening times, advice type offered etc.. using an information table which can be filtered to their needs. The data is given through Open Data Bristol's data centre titled 'Advice Drop-In Centre'.
