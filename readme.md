Where To
The app 'Where To' is designed as one place that a user can go to identify a suitable Advice Drop-In Centre, based on their needs, and be able to locate the ones closest to them via map. The app is also deisgned to give users a direct route and ETA to the Advice Drop-In Centre using their prefered mode of transport (walk, bike, car, public transport etc..). The app is also able to give users additional information about each centre such as written address, opening times, advice type offered etc.. using an information table which can be filtered to their needs. The data is given through Open Data Bristol's data centre titled 'Advice Drop-In Centre' https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/datasets/bcc::advice-drop-in/explore
